#to convert from seconds to hours and minutes
'''27. Write a class called Time whose only field is a time in seconds. It should 
have a method called convert_to_minutes that returns a string of minutes and 
seconds formatted as in the following example: if seconds is 230, the method 
should return '5:50'. It should also have a method called convert_to_hours
that returns a string of hours, minutes, and seconds formatted analogously 
to the previous method.

class Time:
    def __init__(self,s):
        self.s=s
    def c_to_m(self):
        m=self.s//60
        s=self.s-m*60
        print(m,":",s)
    def c_to_h(self):
        h=self.s//3600
        s=self.s-h*3600
        m=s//60
        s=s-m*60
        print(h,":",m,":",s)
